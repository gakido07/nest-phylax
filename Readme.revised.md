With minimal configuration, [NEW NAME UNKNOWN] can:

- Automatically generate authentication endpoints for login, access tokens, and refresh tokens.
- Secure routes using decorators or globally applied guards.
- Manage role-based access control (RBAC) and permission-based logic.
- Integrate with your user and session models.
- Work seamlessly with JWTs, Passport strategies, or custom token providers.
